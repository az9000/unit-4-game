**Star Wars RPG**
##Summary##
A web-based jQuery game, in which the player picks one of four characters that would fight the other three characters, until that character wins, or loses the game.

##How to play##
Each character has a *healthpoint* value printed at the bottom of that character's picture.
Once a character is selected, the remaining characters are moved to the *Enemies Available To Attack* area.
Click an enemy, and that enemy will now move to the *Defender* area. The *attack" button is now available to the player in the *Fight" section!

Clicking the **attack** button, will result in your character damaging the defender, as well as suffering damage from the defender. Your character's attach power increases every time the **attack** button is clicked.

When a *Defender* is defeated, select another enemy and repeat.

When a character's *healthpoints* drop to zero ore less, that character is **defeated**!

A **Reset** button at the bottom of the page will allow you to restart the game.
